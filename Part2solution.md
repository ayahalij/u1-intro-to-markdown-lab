**When starting a new web project, setting up a solid foundation** is crucial. An *HTML* boilerplate serves as this foundation, providing a standard starting point that ensures best practices and compatibility across different browsers.

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h2>Welcome To GFG</h2>
    <p>
        Default code has been
        loaded into the Editor.
    </p>
</body>

</html>
```

An HTML boilerplate is a set of pre-written HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that form the starting point for your web project. It includes essential elements like the doctype declaration, meta tags, link to CSS files, and script tags for JavaScript. The primary goal is to save time and ensure consistency by providing a robust template that follows industry standards.

# 2. Why Use an HTML Boilerplate?
Using an HTML boilerplate has several benefits:

* **Efficiency:** Quickly set up new projects without rewriting the same basic structure each time.
* **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent structure and style across multiple projects.
* **Best Practices:** Follow industry standards and best practices out of the box.
* ***Cross-browser Compatibility:** Ensure your site works well across different browsers and devices.

# 3. Components of HTML Boilerplate

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

``` HTML

    </header>
    <main>
        <p>This is where your content goes.</p>
